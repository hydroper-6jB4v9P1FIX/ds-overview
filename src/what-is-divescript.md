# What is DiveScript

DiveScript (“DS”) is a lightweight multi-paradigm statically-typed programming language. It includes a standard library and a package manager and compiles to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org).

DiveScript derives syntax and semantics from the [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) language, with the most notable difference of not including the borrow type and a simplified ecosystem similiar to that of Java.

This overview assumes basic familiarity with the Rust language.
